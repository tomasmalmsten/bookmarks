# Political articles
This section is a cureated collection of links to articles of a more political nature. I have read all
articles listed here and they are interesting, thought provocing and some times even provocative.

* [How to change the course of human history](https://www.eurozine.com/change-course-human-history/)
  by David Graeber and David Wengrow. This article disusses the common narative to human history in relation to
  inequality and argues that it is wrong.
* [The Bully's Pulpit](https://thebaffler.com/salvos/bullys-pulpit) - David Graeber looks at bullying, in detail as well as
  from a global perspecive. And also takes a closer look at the tree parties taking part in bullying, the bully, the bullied
  and the audience.
